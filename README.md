Bamazon application is an Amazon-like storefront.  The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

Bamazon first showns a list of products in the store for sale, then it prompts users to enter the product they wish to buy, and then prompts the second messge for users to enter the total units they want to buy. Once the customer has placed the order, the application check if the store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request. If not, the app logs an `Insufficient quantity!` message, and then prevent the order from going through.  However, if Babazon store _does_ have enough of the product, the app will fulfill the customer's order and shows the purchase receipt to the customers.
